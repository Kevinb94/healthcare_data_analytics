# ðŸ“¦ Data Engineering Project Collection

Welcome to my **Data Engineering Lab** â€” a collection of hands-on, containerized projects designed to explore and practice key concepts in modern data engineering.

Each subproject in this repository is self-contained and focuses on a specific skill area, tool, or real-world workflow. All environments are powered by **Docker Compose** and built for reproducibility.
